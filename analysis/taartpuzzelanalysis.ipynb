The newer version (not implemented in the model yet) tried to this by checking how common the last letter is, and checkign the least likely \"transition\" (word boundary or transition). This didn't improve it much, probably because the combination of two last letters says more (see the exmaple), but that requires some thinking on how to compare transtions with two letter endings - are these the same on average?"
